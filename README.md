2. If playing against AI, choose a difficulty level
3. Player X always goes first
4. Click on any empty cell to place your mark

## Technical Highlights

### Minimax Algorithm
The AI uses the [Minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) for optimal decision-making in the "Impossible" difficulty, making it unbeatable. The algorithm recursively evaluates all possible game states to choose the best move.

### Responsive Design
The game adapts to various screen sizes:
- Desktop (1024px+)
- Tablet (481px - 1023px)
- Mobile (up to 480px)
- Landscape mode support
- Touch device optimizations

### CSS Custom Properties
Theming is implemented using CSS custom properties (variables), allowing seamless theme switching without JavaScript style manipulation.

## Browser Support
